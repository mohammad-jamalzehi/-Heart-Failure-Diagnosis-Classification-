# Heart-Failure-Diagnosis-Classification

For this particular project, the decision was made to apply a classification algorithm to a dataset 
with medical subject matter. Classification algorithms have become popular for medical 
projects due to the evolving nature of the subject and their useful function. Consequently, we 
selected the "Heart Failure Prediction Dataset" for our project.
Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for the highest number of fatalities worldwide, 
claiming approximately 17.9 million lives annually, which equates to 31% of all deaths 
globally. Heart attacks and strokes account for the majority of these deaths, with 4 out of 5 
being attributed to these events. Moreover, a third of these deaths occur prematurely in 
individuals aged below 70 years. [1] Early detection and management of heart disease is 
essential for improving patient outcomes. Machine learning models can be a valuable tool for 
early detection, as they can identify patterns in data that may not be visible to the human eye. 
In this project, we will explore a dataset consisting of 11 clinical features that have been 
collected to predict heart disease events. These features include age, sex, chest pain type, 
resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram (ECG) 
results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, old peak (ST depression induced by 
exercise relative to rest), and ST-slope. The primary objective is to utilize these features to 
predict the presence or absence of heart disease, which all of these features will be discussed 
in more detail later in this report.
In this project, extensive research was conducted on each feature incorporated in the model, 
aiming to gain an in-depth understanding of its clinical definition and potential impact on heart 
disease. Moreover, several books were consulted, which were introduced, to ensure the optimal 
implementation of classification methods. Reading these books offered insights into a variety 
of new and different techniques that could be leveraged to enhance the classification process.
